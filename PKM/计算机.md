## 如何同时使用多个 Github 账户

1. Create a New SSH Key
	- `ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your-email-address"`
	- save the file as `~/.ssh/YOUR_NAME_rsa` instead of `~/.ssh/id_rsa`
1. Attach the New Key
	- `pbcopy < ~/.ssh/YOUR_NAME_rsa.pub`
	- Paste this into the GitHub "add new ssh key" area
	- because we saved our key with a unique name, we need to tell SSH about it: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/YOUR_NAME_rsa`
1. Open Config file: `s ~/.ssh/config`
	- add new account into `config`

		```
		Host YOUR_NAME
		HostName github.com
		User git
		IdentityFile ~/.ssh/YOUR_NAME_rsa
		```

1. Change git origin url `git remote add origin git@YOUR_NAME:user/repo.git`

Character | Meaning | Example
--------- | ---------------------------------------------  |  ---
`.`       | Matches any single character                   |  `c.t` will match `cat`, `cot`, `cut`, etc.
`+`       | Repeats the previous match one or more times   |  `a+` matches `a`, `aa`, `aaa`, etc
`*`       | Repeats the previous match zero or more times  |  `a*` matches all the same things `a+` matches, but will also match an empty string
`?`       | Makes the match optional                       |  `colou?r` will match `color` and `colour`
`^`       | Called an anchor, matches the beginning of the string  |  `^a` matches a string that begins with `a`
`$`       | The other anchor, this matches the end of the string   |  `a$` matches a string that ends with `a`
`( )`     | Groups several characters into a single unit, and captures a match for use in a backreference  |  `(ab)+` matches `ababab` - that is, the `+` applies to the group
`[ ]`     | A character class - matches one of the characters  |  `c[uoa]t` matches `cut`, `cot` or `cat`.
`[^ ]`    | Negative character class - matches any character not specified  |  `c[^/]t` matches `cat` or `c=t` but not `c/t`

In mod_rewrite the ! character can be used before a regular expression to negate it. This is, a string will be considered to have matched only if it does not match the rest of the expression.

**Regex Back-Reference Availability**

One important thing here has to be remembered: Whenever you use parentheses in Pattern or in one of the CondPattern, back-references are internally created which can be used with the strings `$N` and `%N` (see below). These are available for creating the strings Substitution and TestString as outlined in the following chapters. Figure 1 shows to which locations the back-references are transferred for expansion as well as illustrating the flow of the RewriteRule, RewriteCond matching. In the next chapters, we will be exploring how to use these back-references, so do not fret if it seems a bit alien to you at first.
